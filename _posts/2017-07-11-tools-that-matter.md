A few days ago, it was announced that Joe Hruska, the founder and CEO of RescueTime, passed away after a long battle with cancer. I never knew or had any connection with Joe, but hearing this news stood out to me in particular because of the impact that RescueTime had on my career, and by extension, my life.

5 years ago, I had a job that paid little and didn't provide much additional value beyond a paycheck. Much of my day was spent on the phone being yelled at by customers, employee retention wasn't a priority, and the growth opportunities in the company were non-existent.  It wasn't a particularly positive period of my life. 

I was on Facebook constantly in those days, consuming curated and crafted glimpses of others' lives and wondering why my mine didn't turn out the same way. 

After hitting rock bottom and seeking help, I began to search for a way out of the dead-end that was my job. I had a freelancer friend that piqued my interest in coding, but it became clear very quickly that learning to code wasn't going to come naturally. I needed to figure out a better way to schedule my time if learning this new skillset was going to be achievable, which is where RescueTime came in.

I'll never forget seeing the first weekly RescueTime report when it hit my inbox. Almost 18 hours of total Facebook use.



This blog might not exist right now if it weren't for RescueTime.  I might not be writing software for a living if it weren't for RescueTime.
