A few days ago, it was announced that Joe Hruska, the founder and CEO of RescueTime, passed away after a long battle with cancer. I never knew or had any connection with Joe, but hearing this news stood out to me in particular because of the impact that his app, [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/), had on the formation of my career.

5 years ago, I had a job that didn't pay much and didn't provide much additional value beyond that paycheck. Much of my day was spent on the phone being yelled at by customers, employee retention wasn't a priority, and the growth opportunities within the organization were non-existent.  It wasn't a particularly positive period of my life. 

I was on Facebook constantly in those days, consuming curated and crafted glimpses of others' lives and wondering why my mine didn't turn out the same way. Quite simply, it wasn't a sustainable lifestyle.  

After seeking help, I began to search for a way out of the dead-end job, which turned out to be coding. I had a freelancer friend that piqued my interest in coding, but it became clear very quickly that learning to code wasn't going to come naturally. I needed to figure out a better way to schedule my time if learning this new skillset was going to be achievable.

Fortunately, I found this great app called RescueTime that tracked and categorized application usage into productive and unproductive subcategories. Using this tool, I was able to devote a sizeable amount of my free time towards acheiving a long-term goal while still earning a paycheck.

After about 6 months of managing my computer usage via RescueTime, I was well into laying the foundation of my next career after work, with little desire to get back on Facebook. I never looked back. 

5 years later, I recall that part of my life and think about all of the people and tools that led me to this point. So many people made vast differences in my career and life, and continue to do so today. Between the mentors, bosses, coworkers, and friends, Joe absolutely made a difference in my life simply by building something that matters.
