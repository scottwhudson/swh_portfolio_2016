title: About
---

Born in Colorado and raised in Kentucky, I now live among the taco trucks and live music joints in Austin, Texas. I stumbled into the software world in early 2013, working in various sales and support positions for tech companies around town, eventually moving into software development in 2014.

This blog is a random collection of thoughts and reflections on the journeys of software development and life.
